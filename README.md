#btc_halving

This project is part of my econometrics coursework, in which I examine the claim that Bitcoin returns are driven by halving events. I argue that under the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), halving events are fully predictable and therefore should not systematically affect Bitcoin returns. I also test other explanations for abnormal returns consistent with market efficiency.
